# An index tells the position of the first occurence of the specified value in a list of a string.  Python follows zero-based indexing, so the first string in Hello is H = 0.

# if we want to get an index of a character in  a string in python, we can do this using square brackets '[]'

string = 'I am a string'

print(string[0]) # prints 'I'
print(string[1]) # prints space(empty beacuse there was a space)
print(string[2]) # prints 'a'
print(string[3]) # prints 'm'
# Goes on -------
