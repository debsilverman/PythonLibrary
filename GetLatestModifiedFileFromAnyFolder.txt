# when working in python it's common doubt how to get the latest edited of created file ofrom any folder within the system.  so, this code

import os.path
import os
import glob

# C:/Users/jainh
home = os.path.expanduser("~").replace('\\','/')

# It gives us the latest edited folder ; Output: Downloads
latest_edited_folder = max([f for f in os.scandir(home)], key=lambda x: x.stat().st_mtime).name

# Combine our home directory + our 'latest_edited_folder' + add '/*'
search_on = home+'/'+latest_edited_folder+'/*'

# return all file paths that match ojr pattern 
list_of_files = glob.glob(search_on) 

# It gives us the latest edited file
latest_file = max(list_of_files, key=os.path.getctime)

# Print it ; Output: C:/Users/jainh/Downloads\MyrecentFIle.docs
print(latest_file)

## what is glob module? glob stands for global and it is used to look for a list of files inthe filesystem with names matching a specific pattern.  In our case we looked for files on  the very recently edited folder (list_of_files = glob.glob(search_on)

## what is os.path.expanduser?  it is used to expand a user's home directlry using the ~ (tilde) symbol.  This works on any platform where users have a home directory. For more info about os.scandir method https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-os-scandir-method/
