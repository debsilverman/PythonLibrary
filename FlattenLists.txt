# Flattending a list menas converting a nested list into a one-dimensional list. for example convert [[1,2],[3,4,5]] [1,2,3,4,5] requires deep flattening.  In deep flattening the process undergoes multiple levels of depths to create a flattened list using a modeul iteration_utilities. Iteration_utilities will nbeed to be installed if not already using pip install iteration-utilities

from iteration_utilities import deepflatten

multi_depth_list = [[0,1], [[2]], [3,4]]

flatten_list = list(deepflatten(multi_depth_list))

print(flatten_list)


#There are various other methods too like recursion, shallow flattening, using NumPy. etc.
