# Using list slicing we can take some portions of th elist fromthe original list.  An important thing to note is they they do not change the original list instead return a new list.

# Assume we have a list called 'My_List'.  we can take a portion of it by adding square brackets '[]' and  by providing the 'start index' and the 'stop index' separated by a colon.  We can also tell the function to skip how many items. 

#Syntax: My_List[start:stop:step]


#Sample code

My_List = [1,"one",2.0,'two',True,False]
print(My_List[0:6]) # prints [1, 'one', 2.0, 'two', True,False] (Whole List)
print(My_List[1:3]) # print ['one', 2.0]
print(My_List[3:5]) # prints ['two', True]
print(My_List[0:6:2]) # prints [1, 2.0, True] (skips 1)
